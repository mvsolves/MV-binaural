Hey what's up! Hope all is well.

I am looking to design a binaural beats generator.

My reference: https://syntherjack.net/binaural-beat-generator-1-5-arduino/

My issue is I have little to no experience making circuit diagrams as well as putting all the components together.

I am a software developer so I'm not worried about the code side of things.

Here's what I am looking for:

The parts list
--------------
	- Keep the Arduino nano as brain

	- A OLED 0.96 display (ssd1306 SPI)

	- Two AD9833 only to create sine waves


However, I would like a twist to this:
--------------------------------------
	- I only want one rotary encoder
(ky-040 Rotary Encoder. Essentially, one with a rotary and with a push button all in one)

	- Run on batteries (or some alternative power source other than using the usb)

	- Headphone output to listen to waveform generated sound


If you have suggestions on using different parts or ideas let me know!


Some questions I have:
----------------------
- Is it possible if you can get the PCB board and parts to assemble and then you can send the device? Of course, I would pay for the parts and more if this is feasible.

- Alternatively, I can just take the schematic and buy the parts m
